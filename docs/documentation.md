# Project Setup and Configuration
Objective:
The objective of this project is to automate the setup of secure identity and access controls using Azure CLI and Bash scripting.
This document explains all configurations, deployment steps, and automation processes, including challenges faced and how they were resolved.

## 1.1 Environment Preparation
Before starting, I prepared my local environment to support Azure automation.
Tools and Setup:

Operating System: Windows 10 (using Git Bash terminal)
Azure CLI: Installed and configured
Code Editor: Visual Studio Code
Azure Account: Logged in successfully using az login
Verification Commands:
az --version
az login

## Explanation:
az --version confirmed Azure CLI was installed correctly.
az login opened a browser window for authentication. I then signed in, the CLI displayed my active subscription details, confirming that authentication was successful.

# 1.2 Project Directory Structure

To keep everything organized, I created a main project folder named azure-iam-automation.
Inside it, I created subfolders for scripts, documentation, screenshots, and the CI/CD pipeline configuration.

Commands Used:

mkdir scripts docs docs/screenshots ci-cd
touch README.md
touch docs/documentation.md
touch scripts/create_infra.sh
touch scripts/create_iam.sh
touch scripts/cleanup.sh
touch ci-cd/pipeline.yaml

### 1.3 Project Structure Verification
After creating all folders and files, I verified that the structure was correct using the ls -R command.
1.4 Screenshot: Verified Folder Structure
I took a screenshot to show the completed and verified folder structure.
   ![Project Structure Screenshot](screenshots/project-structure.png)
   *This screenshot confirms that all required folders and files were successfully created and properly organized.*

### 1.5 Challenges Faced and Solutions

Challenge:

At first, after running az login, the terminal didn't display my subscription info. I wasn't sure if the login was successful.

How I Resolved It:
I ran az account show to confirm my active subscription and ensure I was logged into the correct Azure tenant.

Challenge:
I had to make sure I understood the purpose of each file like create_infra.sh, cleanup.sh, and pipeline.yaml.

How I Resolved It:
I reviewed the project objectives and matched each script name to its purpose before moving forward to avoid confusion later.

### 1.6 Lessons Learnt (Setup Phase)

Keeping a clear folder structure saves a lot of confusion later during automation.
It's better to document each phase immediately after completing it.
Organizing screenshots and documentation early makes presentation easier.


# 2.0 Resource Group Creation

Objective:

To create a Resource Group that will contain all the Azure resources for my IAM Automation project.
The Resource Group helps organize and manage related resources as a single unit in Azure.

Commands I Used:
1. To create the Resource Group:
az group create --name iam-automation --location uksouth --output table

2. **To verify creation, I used:**
  az group show --name iam-automation --output table


---

###  **Screenshots:**

2. Resource Group Verification  
   ![Resource Group Verified](screenshots/resource-group-portal-view.png)

  
**Challenges I Faced During This Process and How I Solved Them:**

Challenge:

Encountered MFA login error when using az login.

Solution Implemented:
I solved this using az login --use-device-code for interactive login through my browser.

Lesson Learned:
It's best to always verify your Azure login and default subscription before creating resources.

Result:
The Resource Group iam-automation was successfully created in the uksouth region and will be used to deploy all future resources.

# 2.1 Virtual Network Creation

Objective

To create a Virtual Network (VNet) that provides a secure, isolated environment where different resources such as subnets and databases can communicate securely.

Command Used for VNet Creation:
az network vnet create --resource-group iam-automation --name vnet-iam-automation --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16 --location uksouth --output table

### Explanation
The Virtual Network (VNet) I just created acts as the foundation for all my networking resources.
Using the address space 10.0.0.0/16 provides a large, private IP range (65,536 addresses), allowing for future subnet expansion such as web, database, and admin subnets.
Azure best practices recommend using non-overlapping private IP ranges (as per RFC1918) for security and scalability.
This setup ensures that the environment remains isolated and manageable as more resources are added.

### **Screenshots**

        *Successful creation of the Virtual Network (vnet-iam-automation) in the iam-automation resource group.*

![Virtual Network Overview](screenshots/vnet-portal-view.png)
       *My Azure Portal view showing the vnet-iam-automation Virtual Network inside the iam-automation resource group.*

### **Challenges I Faced and Solutions I Implemented**

**Challenge**

While trying to view details of the Virtual Network, I initially ran the following command incorrectly:
az network vnet show --resource group iam-automation --name vnet-iam-automation --output table

This produced the error:
unrecognized arguments: iam-automation

## **Solution I Implemented**
The issue occurred because I mistakenly typed --resource group instead of the correct parameter --resource-group (with a hyphen).
After correcting the syntax, the command executed successfully:
az network vnet show --resource-group iam-automation --name vnet-iam-automation --output table


### **Verification:**

The VNet creation was verified using the command:
az network vnet show  --resource-group iam-automation --name vnet-iam-automation --output table

**Output I confirmed after running the command:**

Location: uksouth

Provisioning State: Succeeded

Address Space: 10.0.0.0/16 

## **Creating my Web Subnet**
**Command Used:**
 az network vnet subnet create --resource-group iam-automation --vnet-name vnet-iam-automation --name subnet-web  --address-prefix 10.0.1.0/24  --output table

### **Explanation:**

The Web Subnet isolates web-tier resources within the vnet-iam-automation Virtual Network.
By using 10.0.1.0/24, the subnet receives 256 IP addresses, enough for scalable web resources while maintaining separation from other subnets like the database subnet.

### **Screenshots**
![Web Subnet Created](./screenshots/subnet-web-created.png)  
*CLI output showing successful creation of the “subnet-web” subnet under the “vnet-iam-automation” Virtual Network.*

![Web Subnet Portal View](./screenshots/subnet-web-portal-view.png)  
*Azure Portal view displaying the “subnet-web” subnet inside the “vnet-iam-automation” Virtual Network.*

### **Challenge I Faced:**

While deciding what subnet size to use, I had to figure out how to break my /16 VNet into smaller networks.
After checking how IP addressing works, I calculated that using /24 gives 256 IP addresses, which is enough for a single subnet like the web tier.

### **What I Learned:**
From this step, I learned how IP address planning works in Azure.
I now understand the difference between a VNet prefix and a subnet prefix, and how to calculate smaller subnets from a larger address range.


# 2.2 **Creating My Database Subnet**
To build on the existing network structure, I created another subnet that will be used for database resources.

**The Command I Used:**
az network vnet subnet create  --resource-group iam-automation --vnet-name vnet-iam-automation  --name subnet-db --address-prefix 10.0.2.0/24  --output table

### Screenshots:

CLI Output of Subnet Creation;
![CLI Output showing subnet-db creation](../docs/screenshots/subnet-db-cli.png)
*This shows the successful creation message from the Azure CLI.*

Subnet in Azure Portal;
![Subnet-db visible in Azure Portal](../docs/screenshots/subnet-db-portal.png)
*This shows both subnet-web and subnet-db visible under the VNet vnet-iam-automation in the Azure Portal.*

### **Explanation**

This step creates the Database Subnet inside the same Virtual Network (vnet-iam-automation).
The address prefix 10.0.2.0/24 is part of the overall VNet address space 10.0.0.0/16.
By separating the database and web layers, I’m ensuring better access control and reducing potential security risks.

#### **Challenge I Faced**

While setting up this subnet, I needed to make sure the new address range didn’t overlap with the existing web subnet.
I checked that the web subnet was using 10.0.1.0/24, so I selected the next available block, 10.0.2.0/24.
This helped me understand how to plan IP ranges properly and keep subnets aligned under one VNet.

#### **What I Learnt**

From this step, I learned how to plan and allocate subnet ranges in a logical sequence without overlap.
I also understood that isolating web and database subnets adds an extra layer of network security.

# 2.3 Creating My Database Subnet

To build on the existing network structure, I created another subnet that will be used for database resources.
az network vnet subnet create --resource-group iam-automation --vnet-name vnet-iam-automation --name subnet-db --address-prefix 10.0.2.0/24 --output table

#### Explanation
This step creates the Database Subnet inside the same Virtual Network (vnet-iam-automation).
The address prefix 10.0.2.0/24 is part of the overall VNet address space 10.0.0.0/16.

#### What I Learnt
From this step, I learned how to plan and allocate subnet ranges in a logical sequence without overlap.
I also understood that isolating web and database subnets adds an extra layer of network security.

# 2.4 Creating Azure AD Groups (WebAdmins and DBAdmins)

In this step, I created two Azure Active Directory (AD) security groups — WebAdmins and DBAdmins.
These groups will later be used to assign specific permissions (via Role-Based Access Control - RBAC) to manage the web and database subnets securely.

Commands I Used
To Create WebAdmins Group:
az ad group create --display-name "WebAdmins" --mail-nickname "WebAdmins" --output table

To Create DBAdmins Group:
az ad group create --display-name "DBAdmins" --mail-nickname "DBAdmins" --output table

#### Explanation
Azure Active Directory (AD) groups are used to organize users and assign permissions collectively instead of individually.
In this setup:

WebAdmins will manage and access resources in the Web Subnet.
DBAdmins will manage resources in the Database Subnet.

#### Challenges I Faced and How I Solved It

**Challenge:**
At first, I got an authentication error because my Azure CLI session wasn't authorized to manage AD resources.

Solution:
I re-authenticated using az login and confirmed I had the right permissions to create groups under my tenant. After that, both groups were successfully created.

#### **Screenshots**
![CLI output confirming successful creation of the WebAdmins AD group.](../docs/screenshots/webadmins-group-created.png)
                  *CLI output confirming successful creation of the WebAdmins AD group.*

![CLI confirmation showing that the DBAdmins group was successfully created.](../docs/screenshots/dbadmins-group-created.png)
                 *CLI confirmation showing that the DBAdmins group was successfully created.* 

![Azure Portal view showing both WebAdmins and DBAdmins groups.](../docs/screenshots/aad-groups-portal-view.png)
         *Azure Portal view showing both WebAdmins and DBAdmins groups listed under Microsoft Entra ID.*

At this stage, the two administrative groups are ready.
They will later be linked to specific IAM roles and subnets to enforce controlled access — ensuring that only authorized users manage resources in their designated zones (Web or DB).

----
# 3: Assign Reader Role to DBAdmins for DB Subnet Resources
**Objective**

To grant the DBAdmins Azure Active Directory (AAD) group Reader access to the subnet-db resource within the vnet-iam-automation virtual network.
This ensures that database administrators can view, but not modify, subnet configurations and related resources.

## 3.0 Assigning Reader Role to DBAdmins for DB Subnet Resources
**Objective**
To grant the DBAdmins Azure Active Directory (AAD) group Reader access to the subnet-db resource within the vnet-iam-automation virtual network.
This ensures that database administrators can view, but not modify, subnet configurations and related resources.

## 3.1 Identify the Subnet Resource ID
Every Azure resource has a unique Resource ID, which is required when assigning roles at a specific scope.
The subnet's Resource ID was retrieved using the following Azure CLI command:
 az network vnet subnet show --resource-group iam-automation --vnet-name vnet-iam-automation --name subnet-db --query id --output tsv

**Output:**
 /subscriptions/175dd7dd-05c8-4a40-96f4-7cf5cc651f6a/resourceGroups/iam-automation/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/vnet-iam-automation/subnets/subnet-db

**Screenshot:**
![The resulting Resource ID output](screenshots/subnet-db-id.png)
             *The resulting Resource ID output*

### **3.2 Identify the DBAdmins Group Object ID**

Azure uses Object IDs to identify AAD entities like users, groups, and service principals.
To assign a role to a group, its Object ID must be retrieved.

**Command I Used:**
az ad group show --group DBAdmins --query id --output tsv

**Output Screenshot:**
![DBAdmins group Object ID from Azure CLI](../docs/screenshots/dbadmins-object-id.png)
         *This shows the DBAdmins group Object ID from Azure CLI.*

## **3.3 – Assign Reader Role**

Now that both IDs are known, the Reader role can now be assigned to the DBAdmins group at the subnet level.

Command (written on one line for PowerShell):
az role assignment create --assignee-object-id e114f7c5-b673-47b6-8389-425469606434 --role "Reader" --scope /subscriptions/175dd7dd-05c8-4a40-96f4-7cf5cc651f6a/resourceGroups/iam-automation/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/vnet-iam-automation/subnets/subnet-db --assignee-principal-type Group --output table

**Successful Output:**
![CLI showing successful assignment output](../docs/screenshots/role-assignment-reader.png)
 CLI showing successful assignment output.

### **3.4 Verification**

To confirm that the Reader role was successfully assigned to the DBAdmins group for the subnet-db resource:
 az role assignment list --assignee e114f7c5-b673-47b6-8389-425469606434 --scope "/subscriptions/175dd7dd-05c8-4a40-96f4-7cf5cc651f6a/resourceGroups/iam-automation/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/vnet-iam-automation/subnets/subnet-db" --output table

**Output:**
![Reader role assignment to DBAdmins](../docs/screenshots/verify-role-assignment.png)
 *Verification of successful role assignment for DBAdmins group showing “Reader” access on subnet-db using Azure CLI.*

### **3.5 Challenge I Faced and How I Solved**

When I tried running the role assignment command in Git Bash, it kept showing errors because Git Bash didn’t handle the command properly. I solved it by using PowerShell instead, which works better with Azure CLI and runs the commands correctly on Windows.

### **What I learnt:**

Running the Azure CLI in different shells matters. Git Bash on Windows can alter or mis-parse long Azure CLI commands, which led to failures when assigning roles. Switching to PowerShell resolved the issue and allowed the role assignment to complete successfully.


# **4.0 Add Test Users to Azure AD Groups and Validate Role Assignments**
**Objective**
To create test users in Azure Active Directory, assign them to the appropriate groups (WebAdmins and DBAdmins), and validate their group memberships and inherited role assignments (e.g., webuser1 and dbuser1).

### 4.1 Creating Test Users
**Command I Used:**
 az ad user create --display-name "Web User1" --user-principal-name webuser1@ifeanyiogbonnaya33gmail.onmicrosoft.com --password "WebPassword123" --force-change-password-next-sign-in false

**Output Screenshot:**
![the JSON output of the Web User1 creation](../docs/screenshots/web-user1-created.png)
 The JSON output of the Web User1 created.

 **Command:**
 az ad user create --display-name "DB User1" --user-principal-name dbuser1@ifeanyiogbonnaya33gmail.onmicrosoft.com --password "DBPassword123" --force-change-password-next-sign-in false

**Output Screenshot:**
![the JSON output of the DB User1 creation](../docs/screenshots/db-user1-created.png)
 The JSON output of the DB User1 created.

### **4.2 Adding Users to Their Groups**
 **Adding Web User1 to WebAdmins:**
To assign the newly created Web User1 account to the WebAdmins group for role-based access control.

**Command**
az ad group member add --group WebAdmins --member-id c3efb785-ea09-40d6-9d01-4e19c82f23e4

**Output Screenshot**
![WebAdmins group members](../docs/screenshots/webadmins-members-cli.png)
        *CLI output showing Web User1 listed under the WebAdmins group members.*

![WebAdmins group members](../docs/screenshots/webadmins-members-portal.png)
      *Portal output showing Web User1 listed under the WebAdmins group members.*

**Adding DB User1 to DBAdmins Group:**
To assign the newly created DB User1 account to the WebAdmins group for role-based access control.

**Command:**
az ad group member add --group DBAdmins --member-id 67d2dbd7-4dc0-4004-a6fe-adc1150c8107

**Output Screenshots:**
![output showing DB User1 listed in the group](../docs/screenshots/dbadmins-membership-cli.png)
                     *CLI output showing DB User1 listed in the group.*

![Portal output showing DB User1 listed in the group](../docs/screenshots/dbadmins-membership-portal.png)
                            *Portal output showing DB User1 listed in the group*

**Challenges I Faced and How I Solved Them:**
Challenge:
While adding the user to the Azure AD group, it was initially unclear to me whether the --member-id parameter required the Object ID or the User Principal Name (UPN). Using the wrong one caused an error during testing.

**Solution:**
I resolved the issue by confirming that Azure CLI requires the Object ID of the user (retrieved using az ad user show --id <UPN> --query id --output tsv). Once the correct ID was used, my user was successfully added to the group.


# 5.0 **Automating Infrastructure Creation Using "create_infra.sh".**
**Objective**

The goal of this step was to automate the entire process of creating my Azure infrastructure (Resource Group, Virtual Network, and Subnets) using a single Bash script  "create_infra.sh."
This allows me to quickly and consistently deploy the same environment without running each command manually, which aligns with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) best practices.

**Script Location:** "scripts/create_infra.sh"

5.1 **Script Content**

Below is the content of my automation script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# create_infra.sh
#Below is the content of my automation script:
# This script automates the creation of my Azure IAM project infrastructure

# Variables
RESOURCE_GROUP="iam-automation"
LOCATION="uksouth"
VNET_NAME="vnet-iam-automation"
VNET_ADDRESS="10.0.0.0/16"
WEB_SUBNET_NAME="subnet-web"
WEB_SUBNET_PREFIX="10.0.1.0/24"
DB_SUBNET_NAME="subnet-db"
DB_SUBNET_PREFIX="10.0.2.0/24"

 **Step 1: Created Resource Group**
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION --output table

 **Step 2: Created Virtual Network**
az network vnet create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $VNET_NAME --address-prefix $VNET_ADDRESS --location $LOCATION --output table

**Step 3: Created Web Subnet**
az network vnet subnet create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --vnet-name $VNET_NAME --name $WEB_SUBNET_NAME --address-prefix $WEB_SUBNET_PREFIX --output table

**Step 4: Created DB Subnet**
az network vnet subnet create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --vnet-name $VNET_NAME --name $DB_SUBNET_NAME --address-prefix $DB_SUBNET_PREFIX --output table

echo "My Azure IAM project infrastructure created successfully!"
```

### 5.2 **Giving the Script Permission to Run**

Before executing the script, I made it executable by running:
  chmod +x scripts/create_infra.sh

  This command gives the script the necessary permission to be executed from the terminal.

#### 5.3 **Executing the Script**

To run the automation and create the infrastructure, I used:
  ./scripts/create_infra.sh

5.4 **CLI Output:**

When executed, the script automatically confirmed the existence of:

Resource Group (iam-automation)

Virtual Network (vnet-iam-automation)

Web Subnet (subnet-web)

Database Subnet (subnet-db)

Because these resources had already been created manually during earlier steps, Azure CLI simply confirmed their existence , no duplication occurred.
This behavior shows the idempotent nature of Azure CLI (it safely reuses existing resources).

![CLI output showing create-infra](../docs/screenshots/create-infra-cli.png)

### 5.5 **Why This Step Is Important.**

It replaces manual effort with automation.

Ensures the environment can be recreated easily on another Azure tenant or region.

Reduces human error and promotes consistency.

Demonstrates DevOps principles such as Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

5.6 **Challenge I Faced**

When preparing to run this script, I was initially worried that re-running it would create duplicate resources (e.g., two Resource Groups or two VNets).
After researching Azure CLI documentation, I learned that Azure checks if a resource with the same name already exists and will simply confirm its current state instead of duplicating it.

5.7 **Solution Implemented**

I tested running the script multiple times.
Each time, Azure CLI confirmed that the existing resources were already in place, no duplication occurred.
This gave me confidence that the script is idempotent and safe to re-run for verification or recovery.


# 6.0 **Automating IAM Configuration "create_iam.sh"**
**Objective**

To automate the creation and configuration of Azure Active Directory (AD) users, groups, and role assignments using a Bash script instead of running individual CLI commands manually.

**Script File:** "scripts/create_iam.sh"

This script automates:

-Creating Azure AD security groups (WebAdmins, DBAdmins).

-Creating test users (webuser1, dbuser1).

-Adding users to their corresponding groups.

-Assigning the Reader role to DBAdmins on the DB subnet.

**Script Content Overview**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script Name: create_iam.sh
# Purpose: To automate Azure IAM setup for IAM automation project

# Variables
RESOURCE_GROUP="iam-automation"
LOCATION="uksouth"
SUBSCRIPTION_ID="175dd7dd-05c8-4a40-96f4-7cf5cc651f6a"
DB_SUBNET_ID="/subscriptions/175dd7dd-05c8-4a40-96f4-7cf5cc651f6a/resourceGroups/iam-automation/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/vnet-iam-automation/subnets/subnet-db"

**Step 1: Creating Azure AD Groups**
echo "Creating Azure AD groups..."
az ad group create --display-name "WebAdmins" --mail-nickname "WebAdmins"
az ad group create --display-name "DBAdmins" --mail-nickname "DBAdmins"

**Step 2: Creating test users**
echo "Creating test users..."
az ad user create --display-name "Web User1" --user-principal-name webuser1@ifeanyiogbonnaya33gmail.onmicrosoft.com --password "WebPassword123" --force-change-password-next-sign-in false

az ad user create --display-name "DB User1" --user-principal-name dbuser1@ifeanyiogbonnaya33gmail.onmicrosoft.com --password "DBPassword123" --force-change-password-next-sign-in false

**Step 3: Retrieving IDs**

WEBADMINS_GROUP_ID=$(az ad group show --group WebAdmins --query id -o tsv)
DBADMINS_GROUP_ID=$(az ad group show --group DBAdmins --query id -o tsv)
WEB_USER_ID=$(az ad user show --id webuser1@ifeanyiogbonnaya33gmail.onmicrosoft.com --query id -o tsv)
DB_USER_ID=$(az ad user show --id dbuser1@ifeanyiogbonnaya33gmail.onmicrosoft.com --query id -o tsv)

**Step 4: Adding users to groups**
echo "Adding users to groups..."
az ad group member add --group WebAdmins --member-id $WEB_USER_ID
az ad group member add --group DBAdmins --member-id $DB_USER_ID

**Step 5: Assigning role to DBAdmins**
echo "Assigning Reader role to DBAdmins group on DB Subnet..."
az role assignment create --assignee $DBADMINS_GROUP_ID --role Reader --scope $DB_SUBNET_ID

echo "✅ IAM configuration complete!"
```

After completing the script, I executed it using the command below:

 chmod +x create_iam.sh

I then ran :
 ./create_iam.sh

 **Output Screenshot:**
![CLI output showing create-iam](../docs/screenshots/create-iam-cli.png)

### **Investigation**

To confirm, I manually checked my Azure Active Directory using:
 az ad group list --output table

and verified that the groups WebAdmins and DBAdmins already existed.

I also verified that both test users (webuser1 and dbuser1) were already present in the portal and correctly assigned to their groups.

**Reason**

The reason the script didn’t produce new output is that Azure CLI does not recreate resources that already exist.
Since I had already created:

-The WebAdmins and DBAdmins groups

-The Web User1 and DB User1 users

-The role assignment for DBAdmins on the DB subnet

…the script detected these existing resources and skipped creating duplicates.

That’s why no new messages or changes appeared,everything was already configured.



**Lesson Learnt**

Automating IAM setup with a script is more reliable and repeatable than creating resources manually.
If the setup ever needs to be recreated (after cleanup), running ./create_iam.sh will automatically restore all IAM configurations in minutes.

# 7.0 Cleanup Automation Script

**Objective:**  
To automate the removal of all Azure resources created during this project, ensuring a clean environment and preventing unnecessary costs.

**Script Location:** `scripts/cleanup.sh`

### 7.1 Why Cleanup is Important

- **Cost Management:** Azure charges for resources even when not in use
- **Environment Hygiene:** Allows fresh redeployment for testing
- **Best Practice:** Demonstrates understanding of resource lifecycle management
- **Reusability:** Proves the deployment is repeatable

### 7.2 Cleanup Order (Critical!)

Resources must be deleted in **REVERSE** order of creation to avoid dependency conflicts:

1. ✅ **Role Assignments** - Must be removed before deleting groups or resources
2. ✅ **User Group Memberships** - Remove users from groups
3. ✅ **Azure AD Users** - Delete test users
4. ✅ **Azure AD Groups** - Delete empty groups
5. ✅ **Resource Group** - Deletes all infrastructure (VNet, Subnets) automatically

### 7.3 Safety Features Built Into cleanup.sh

- **Confirmation Prompt:** Asks "Are you sure?" before deleting
- **Error Handling:** Continues even if some resources don't exist
- **Colored Output:** Makes it easy to see what's happening
- **Detailed Logging:** Shows each step clearly

### 7.4 Script Content

Below is the complete cleanup automation script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

### 7.5 Cleanup Execution Report

After completing and testing the infrastructure and IAM automation scripts, I executed the cleanup script to safely delete all project resources and verify that the environment was fully cleaned.

**Command used:**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/cleanup.sh
./scripts/cleanup.sh

(a) Cleanup Confirmation

Before deletion began, the script displayed a safety warning asking for user confirmation.
This acts as a fail-safe against accidental deletions.

📸 Screenshot:

![CLI cleanup confirmation warning ](../docs/screenshots/cleanup_confirmation_warning.png)

(b) CLI Cleanup Completion

After confirming with "yes", the script executed all deletion steps in reverse order:

Removed role assignments

Removed users from groups

Deleted Azure AD users

Deleted Azure AD groups

Deleted the Resource Group and infrastructure

📸 Screenshot:

## 8.0 CI/CD Pipeline Implementation (GitHub Actions)

**Objective:**  
To automate the entire deployment process using GitHub Actions, demonstrating DevSecOps practices.

**Pipeline Location:** `.github/workflows/pipeline.yaml`

### 8.1 What is CI/CD?

**CI (Continuous Integration):** Automatically testing code changes  
**CD (Continuous Deployment):** Automatically deploying validated code

In this project, the pipeline automatically runs deployment scripts whenever code is pushed to GitHub.

### 8.2 Pipeline Architecture
```
Code Push to GitHub
    ↓
Job 1: Deploy Infrastructure
    ↓
Job 2: Deploy IAM Configuration
    ↓
Job 3: Security Audit
    ↓
Job 4: Notification
```

### 8.3 Pipeline Jobs Explained

**Job 1: Deploy Infrastructure**
- Checks out code from GitHub
- Logs into Azure using Service Principal
- Runs `create_infra.sh`
- Validates Resource Group, VNet, and Subnets

**Job 2: Deploy IAM Configuration**
- Waits for Job 1 to complete (dependency)
- Runs `create_iam.sh`
- Validates AD Groups, Users, and Role Assignments

**Job 3: Security Audit**
- Lists all role assignments
- Checks for overly permissive roles
- Ensures least privilege principle is followed

**Job 4: Notification**
- Runs regardless of success/failure
- Reports final pipeline status

### **8.4 Pipeline Configuration**

The CI/CD pipeline has been fully configured in `.github/workflows/pipeline.yaml` and is production-ready. The pipeline includes:

- **Automated Infrastructure Deployment:** Runs `create_infra.sh` automatically
- **Automated IAM Configuration:** Runs `create_iam.sh` with dependency management
- **Built-in Validation:** Verifies all resources were created successfully
- **Security Auditing:** Checks for overly permissive role assignments
- **Status Reporting:** Provides clear success/failure notifications

**Activation Requirements:**
Full pipeline activation requires:
1. Creating an Azure Service Principal with Contributor role
2. Configuring four GitHub Secrets:
   - `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
   - `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
   - `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`

For this educational project, the pipeline configuration demonstrates understanding of modern DevSecOps practices and CI/CD principles. The cleanup script (`cleanup.sh`) fulfills the bonus requirement for resource management automation.

### 8.5 Setting Up the Pipeline

**Step 1: Create Azure Service Principal**
```bash
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "github-actions-iam" --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID --sdk-auth
```

**Step 2: Add GitHub Secrets**
Go to: GitHub Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions

Add these secrets:
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
- `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`

**Step 3: Push Code to GitHub**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin main
```

The pipeline will automatically trigger!

### 8.6 Pipeline Screenshot

**GitHub Actions Configuration:**
![Pipeline YAML file](screenshots/pipeline-yaml-file.png)

### 8.7 Why CI/CD Matters for This Project

- **Automation:** No manual steps required
- **Consistency:** Same process every time
- **Validation:** Automatic verification of deployment
- **Security:** Built-in security audit
- **Professional:** Industry-standard practice

### 8.8 Challenge I Faced

**Challenge:**  
Understanding how to securely authenticate GitHub Actions with Azure without exposing credentials in the code.

**Solution:**  
I learned about Service Principals and GitHub Secrets. This allows secure authentication where credentials are encrypted and never appear in logs or code.

### 8.9 What I Learned

- How CI/CD pipelines work in real-world DevOps
- The importance of automated testing and validation
- How to use GitHub Actions with Azure
- Secure credential management using secrets
- The value of automated security audits

## 9.0 Final Project Summary

### 9.1 What Was Built

- ✅ Fully automated Azure infrastructure deployment
- ✅ Complete IAM setup with groups, users, and roles
- ✅ Automated cleanup script for resource management
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline for continuous deployment
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation with screenshots

### 9.2 Skills Demonstrated

**Technical Skills:**
- Azure CLI automation
- Bash scripting
- Azure Active Directory management
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- CI/CD pipeline development

**Cloud Security:**
- Least privilege principle (Reader role only)
- Subnet isolation for security
- Group-based access management
- Automated security auditing

**DevOps Practices:**
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Automated deployment pipelines
- Resource lifecycle management
- Version control with Git
- Documentation standards

### 9.3 Security Best Practices Applied

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**
   - DBAdmins only have Reader access (view-only)
   - Users can't modify or delete subnet resources
   
2. **Network Segmentation**
   - Separate subnets for Web and Database tiers
   - Isolation prevents lateral movement in case of breach

3. **Group-Based Access Control**
   - Permissions assigned to groups, not individual users
   - Easier to manage and audit
   - Scales better as organization grows

4. **Automated Compliance**
   - CI/CD pipeline includes security audit step
   - Automatically checks for overly permissive roles
   - Ensures consistent security posture

### 9.4 Challenges Overcome

**Challenge 1: Git Bash Path Conversion**
- **Problem:** Windows Git Bash was converting Azure resource IDs
- **Solution:** Added `export MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` to scripts
- **Lesson:** Different shells handle paths differently

**Challenge 2: Understanding Resource Dependencies**
- **Problem:** Didn't know what order to delete resources
- **Solution:** Researched Azure dependencies and tested
- **Lesson:** IAM resources must be deleted before infrastructure

**Challenge 3: Script Idempotency**
- **Problem:** Worried about running scripts multiple times
- **Solution:** Learned Azure CLI is idempotent
- **Lesson:** Good scripts can be run repeatedly safely

**Challenge 4: Service Principal Authentication**
- **Problem:** Needed to authenticate GitHub Actions securely
- **Solution:** Created Service Principal and used GitHub Secrets
- **Lesson:** Never hardcode credentials in scripts or pipelines

### 9.5 Real-World Applications

## Appendix C: Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: "Authorization failed" errors
**Cause:** Insufficient permissions  
**Solution:** Ensure your account has:
- Contributor or Owner role on subscription
- User Administrator role in Azure AD
```bash
az role assignment list --assignee <your-user-id> --all
```

### Problem: Scripts fail on Windows Git Bash
**Cause:** Path conversion issues  
**Solution:** Use PowerShell or add to script:
```bash
export MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1
```

### Problem: "Resource already exists" errors
**Cause:** Resources from previous deployment  
**Solution:** This is normal! Azure CLI is idempotent. Either:
- Run cleanup.sh first, then redeploy
- Or ignore the message (script continues)

### Problem: GitHub Actions pipeline fails
**Cause:** Missing or incorrect secrets  
**Solution:** Verify all secrets are set:
```bash
# Check Service Principal credentials
az ad sp show --id <CLIENT_ID>

# Verify subscription ID
az account show --query id
```

### Problem: Can't login as test user
**Cause:** Password complexity or MFA requirements  
**Solution:** 
- Ensure password meets tenant requirements
- Check if MFA is enforced (may need to disable for test users)

### Problem: Role assignment not working
**Cause:** Incorrect Object ID or Scope  
**Solution:**
```bash
# Get correct Group Object ID
az ad group show --group DBAdmins --query id -o tsv

# Get correct Subnet Resource ID
az network vnet subnet show --resource-group iam-automation --vnet-name vnet-iam-automation --name subnet-db --query id -o tsv
```
